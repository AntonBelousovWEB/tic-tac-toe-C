This project represents my first foray into C programming, creating a simple and enjoyable implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe. Throughout this project, I gained hands-on experience with the Raylib library, a powerful and user-friendly graphics library for C.

## Features

- **User Interaction:** Players can make moves by clicking on the desired cell with the left mouse button.
- **Winning Condition:** The game checks for winning conditions after each move and declares the winner when a player forms a complete row, column, or diagonal.
- **Graphics with Raylib:** The graphical interface is built using Raylib, providing a simple yet effective visual representation of the game.

Happy coding!
